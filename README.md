# puzzle-alarm-clock
An alarm clock that requires you to do different tasks in order to shut it off.
If you fail, then you will be presented with very *pleasant* sounds

Final project for the course *Mobile applications (ITV0140)*.
# Features
Things you have to do:
* point the phone at a light source
* swipe in needed direction while heavy metal / nuclear launch alarm is playing in the background
* answer some true/false questions while the time is ticking *Countdown* style
* choose the correct character speaking (Rick or Morty)
* walk around while "Move Your Feet" is playing
* shake the phone heavily while "Shake Shake Shake" is playing

If you succeed, you are presented with a pleasant wake-up tune.

If you fail, then be ready to hear the screeching voice of Lemonhead or the sun yelling at you.
